# PWA Skeleton app
===============================

This is a streamable template engine controlled by the ServiceWorker.
It's able to take the site offline and manage cache.

The template engine is minimal since it rely on the ES6 template strings
so no parser is necessary. You are able to use any javascript inside the
templates

To familiar with the rest of the application read more about
